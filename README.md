# BeadedBag

This program recreated the infinite bag from Harry Potter. The program will take a list of items that will go in the bag,
it can take infinitely many, and store it in a structure named Item. The program will first check if it is already in the 
bag, to which you cannot place another in the bag, and will then store it in a vector from the Item Structure.
